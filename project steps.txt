1.Initialize uv package manager for the project using uv init AI_Trip_Planner
2.Create requirements.txt & setup.py
3.If you open new cmd it will automatically activate conda env, since we work with uv need to deactivate conda env using "conda deactivate"
4.Use cmd "uv python list" to see the list of python versions venv provided by uv.
5.Create venv using any of the available python version within uv using "uv venv env --python  cpython-3.12.12-windows-x86_64-none"
6.Activate the env using "env\Scripts\activate"
7.To check which are the packages available in the venv use the cmd "uv pip list"
8.To install any packages use the cmd eg: "uv pip install langchain"
    Note : uv is a wrapper on top of pip written in rust language which executes faster than old pip method.
9.Create a folder agent which will carry the scripts of the whole agent workflow
10.Create a folder config which carries all the config related files either python, json or yaml.
11.Create a folder prompt_library to keep all the files related to prompt engineering.
12.Create a folder tools will carry the files which are used by the agents to perform the tasks.
13.Create a folder utils to place all the utility files.
14.Create .env to store the env variables eg: API, Keys
15.Create __init__.py files in all the subfolders
16. -e . in requirements.txt takes care of installing dependencies on a local dir belongs to the current location. Also ot works together with setup.py file which takes care of importing te packages in every files it doesnt require to give the complete relative path og the dependency.
17. Here we follow factory method design pattern of LLD.
18. To run Fastapi app "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload"
19.To run streamlit ui "streamlit run app.py"
